# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms – Pattern-Based LeetCode Solutions

This repository is a **curated collection of the most important DSA problems**, solved **pattern-wise** to build strong problem-solving intuition for **coding interviews**, **competitive programming**, and **systematic revision**.

The problems are carefully selected from **LeetCode** and grouped by **core patterns** frequently asked in product-based companies.

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

* Master **problem-solving patterns**, not just individual questions
* Write **clean, optimized, and interview-ready solutions**
* Understand **intuition, edge cases, and time/space trade-offs**
* Serve as a **quick revision guide** before interviews

---

## 🧠 How to Use This Repo

1. Pick **one pattern at a time**
2. Solve problems **in the given order** (easy → hard)
3. Focus on:

    * Why this pattern works
    * How constraints influence the approach
    * Edge cases
4. Revisit problems after a few days for reinforcement
